When using the AWS console there are little things that
tweak me. One thing is every time I got use the connect
helper it fills in the user name as root. I understands
why one might make root the default. I am mostly usings
the Amazon images with the user being aws-user. I thens
made this plugin to just change it to what I want. Whos
I might even add more little goodies.
